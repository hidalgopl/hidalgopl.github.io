My name is Pawe≈Ç Bojanowski and I'm software engineer based in Warsaw.

I started my career in 2016 in *Risen.*, been doing apps & web back ends in Django. \
After almost two years I joined [*Unit9*](https://unit9.com), been doing there mostly web game backends with [OnePlus Crackables](https://www.unit9.com/project/oneplus-crackables/) as a highlight on my time there. \
My last company was [Sauce Labs](https://www.saucelabs.com), where I was part of Core Services team, working mostly in Python & Go microservices deployed into public & private Kubernetes clusters.

I'm also co-founder of [*SecureAPI*](https://secureapi.dev), automated security test tool for API developers. [Check it out](https://github.com/hidalgopl/sailor)
